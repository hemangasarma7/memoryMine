# memoryMine
memoryMine is a python project built in django. It consists of an app called pictureQ, meant for storing and managing photos and organizing photo albums. The project uses default sqlite3 database to store user data and records of all photos and albums. Using MVT pattern, memoryMine allows you to sign up to create a new user, login with an existing user and logout from a running session using django's auth app. Once logged in, memoryMine allows you to add a new album or photo, view all photos and albums, add description and details for each album/photo, edit details of an album/photo and delete an existing album/photo. Once after running the in-built django web server, following url will redirect to Login Page. http://127.0.0.1:8000/pictureQ/
